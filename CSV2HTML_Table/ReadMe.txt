VerySimple CSV2HTML Converter V0.1 by Manuel du Bois (18.10.2018)
-----------------------------------------------------
The Programm does not have any GUI.

Usage:
Run convert_csv2htmltable.bat next to this file.
The converter will walk though all csv-files in input_csv - Folder and create simple HTML Table structures from them.
Each csv files create one html-file with the same name under output_html with the same name but .html ending.

There are still some limitations:
- The CSV file may only contain one table otherwise faulty html coult be created.
- The CSV file must use ";" as delimiter
